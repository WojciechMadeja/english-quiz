# **English Quiz**

English Quiz is a web application that aims to improve your English language learning. The first stage of work on the project is to program the game as follows: the player must choose the correct answer to the question related to the currently displayed photo. 
He has two hints at his disposal. If the answer is correct, the participant gets a point. 
In case of a wrong answer, he loses one of the three lives received at the start. At any time, the participant can use the "Motivation Cat" button, that displays a random photo of a cat and pauses the quiz. The application is created using React.js, Styled Components and UI of my own project in Figma and Inkscape.
